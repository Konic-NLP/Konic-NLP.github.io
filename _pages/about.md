&nbsp;

A self-driven explorer of NLP and related skills with a strong passion for ML/DL, and software development. I immerse myself in the challenging journey with thorns to enrich my CS skills since I am not a CS guy originally. I love fantastic techniques which bring me instant feedback and a sense of accomplishment.
Right now I am working with Prof. Martha Palmer for the AIDA/KAIROS project to compute the similarity of the events based on Wikidata and [UMR writter](http://umr-tool.cs.brandeis.edu/)(an annotation tool for [Uniform Meaning Representation](https://umr4nlp.github.io/web/index.html))

Now I am a student of [Computational Linguistics, Analytics, Search and Informatics Professional Master’s Degree (CLASIC) program](https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/graduate-program/computational-linguistics-clasic-ms) at [The University of Colorado-Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/).  Such an interdisciplinary degree is offered jointly by The [Departments of Linguistics](https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/) and [Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). I got a B.A. degree in the department of Chinese language and literature at Shanxi University (Major in Chinese language and literature) and M.A. degree from Nanjing Normal University(Major in Linguistics and Applied linguistics). 

I have 4 years+ of Python experience and 2 years+ of NLP research experience. My past work focused on lexical analysis (i.e token classification/sequence labeling tasks like named entity recognition and word segmentation, etc); corpus construction(high-quality annotation for text dataset, especially for semantic role labeling, like [Chinese Abstract Meaning Representation corpus](https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~clp/camr/camr.html) and Chinese FrameNet), and digital humanities(I explore how to structurally represent the meaning of literature like ancient Chinese poems as much as possible).
  
  
Before entering CU-Boulder, I worked as a product manager intern at Beijing Lingosail company(China), designing and upgrading the product ['Termbox'](http://termbox.lingosail.com/) for term extraction.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->
